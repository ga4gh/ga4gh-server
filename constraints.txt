# This file allows our dependencies to be against specific versions
# or git tags. Each line is similar to a requirements.txt line, 
# except that when installing the dependencies, the constraints.txt
# is converted into the `dependency_links` of the setuptools
# packaging script. This allows us to maintain dependencies across
# repositories.
#
# For example, during development we use the development version
# of the schemas with the line:
#
# git+git://github.com/ga4gh/schemas.git@master#egg=ga4gh_schemas
#
# When one has proposed a schema modification, they can change this
# constraint to point at the branch of their proposed change:
#
# git+git://github.com/david4096/schemas.git@protobuf31#egg=ga4gh_schemas
#
# Then, when the change has been accepted at the schemas repository
# you can change this to point back at the master branch!
#
# When making a release, these constraints are changed to point at
# the released dependency.
